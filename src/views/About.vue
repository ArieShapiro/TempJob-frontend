      <p class="about-content" style="margin-top: 20px">Contacting as many people as possible is a highly 
        effective way to find a job. It is estimated that 50% or higher of all jobs are found through 
        networking.

       Job recruiters and decision makers are increasingly using online social networking sites to 
       gather information about job applicants, according to a mid-2011 Jobvite survey of 800 employers
        in the US.

       Likewise, job seekers are beginning to use social networking sites to advertise their skills 
       and post resumes. Today, job seekers can use resources such as Google+’s Circles, Facebook’s 
       BranchOut, LinkedIn’s InMaps, and Twitter’s Lists to make employers notice them in a unique way.
        In 2014, using these social media networks has led to 1 of 6 job seekers finding employment.

       Job seekers need to begin to pay more attention to what employers and recruiters find when they 
       do their pre-interview information gathering about applicants, according to this 2010 study by
        Microsoft, "Online Reputation in a Connected World".</p>
